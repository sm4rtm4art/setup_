## 📖 Introduction

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) is a modern software development practice that helps teams work more efficiently and deliver higher quality code. Here's what it means:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically testing and checking code changes as soon as developers commit them. This catches problems early before they affect others.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automating the process of preparing code for release and deployment. This ensures reliable and repeatable releases.

### Why Use CI/CD?

1. **Catch Problems Early**

   - Find bugs before they reach production
   - Ensure code style consistency
   - Prevent security issues

2. **Save Time**

   - Automated testing saves manual work
   - Faster feedback on changes
   - Reduced debugging time

3. **Better Collaboration**

   - Everyone follows the same quality standards
   - Clear feedback on code changes
   - Documented processes for the team

4. **Reliable Releases**
   - Consistent build process
   - Automated deployment steps
   - Reduced human error

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setting Up Pre-commit

1. Install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

2. Install the hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg  # For commit message checks
```

3. Run against all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Understanding GitLab CI/CD

Our pipeline has four stages:

1. **lint**: Code style and quality checks
2. **test**: Unit and integration tests
3. **build**: Creating releases
4. **deploy**: Documentation deployment

## 🔍 What Gets Checked?

### Pre-commit Hooks

- **Shell Scripts**

  - ShellCheck for best practices
  - Syntax validation

- **Python Code**

  - Black for formatting
  - Ruff for linting
  - MyPy for type checking

- **Java Code**

  - Checkstyle with Google style
  - Basic syntax validation

- **Rust Code**

  - Clippy for best practices
  - Format checking

- **Documentation**

  - Markdown linting
  - YAML validation
  - JSON validation

- **General**
  - Trailing whitespace
  - File endings
  - Large file checks
  - Merge conflict markers
  - Private key detection

### GitLab CI/CD Pipelines

- **For Every Push/MR**

  - Code style checks
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests (on main branch)

- **For Tags**

  - Release builds
  - Documentation updates

- **Scheduled**
  - Version checks
  - Dependency updates

## 💡 Common Tasks

### Fixing Pre-commit Issues

1. **Style Issues**:

```bash
# Auto-fix formatting
pre-commit run black --all-files
pre-commit run ruff --all-files
```

2. **Shell Script Issues**:

```bash
# Check specific file
shellcheck scripts/my_script.sh
```

3. **Skip Checks (Emergency Only)**:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: my change" --no-verify
```

### Working with GitLab CI/CD

1. **View Pipeline Status**:

   - Go to GitLab > CI/CD > Pipelines

2. **Debug Failed Jobs**:

   - Click on the failed job
   - Check the logs
   - Use the "retry" button if needed

3. **Manual Actions**:
   - Some jobs might need manual triggering
   - Look for the "play" button in the pipeline view

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Commits

1. Use conventional commits:

```bash
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug
docs: update documentation
chore: maintenance task
```

2. Keep commits focused and small

### Code Quality

1. Run pre-commit before pushing:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

2. Check pipeline status after pushing

### Documentation

1. Update docs with code changes
2. Use markdown best practices
3. Keep code examples up to date

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit Issues

1. **Hook Installation Failed**:

```bash
pre-commit clean
pre-commit uninstall
pre-commit install
```

2. **Slow Hooks**:

```bash
# Skip slow hooks temporarily
SKIP=mypy git commit -m "feat: my change"
```

### CI/CD Issues

1. **Pipeline Failures**:

   - Check job logs
   - Verify dependencies
   - Test locally first

2. **Environment Issues**:
   - Check .gitlab-ci.yml
   - Verify variables
   - Test in clean environment

- [GitLab CI/CD Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

## 🔄 Update Process

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Edit .gitlab-ci.yml
   - Test in merge request
   - Update documentation
